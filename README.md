# [mulletfingers999.github.io](http://mulletfingers999.github.io)
My github page. Nothing more, nothing less. Feel free to contribute, I'm open to anything. The console is made with jsterm.

## Direcory Structure (JSTerm's)
- [commands](commands) - A JS file with all the possible
  commands that can be run. Add new commands here.
- [config](config) - A JS file that has basic configuration
  information. Change things like the prompt here.
- [css](css) - The CSS used on the page.
- [images](images) - Image files used in your filesystem.
- [js](js) - The jsterm implementation.
- [json](json) - Where the filesystem is stored. Change the
  term.Init() call in [js/jsterm.js](js/jsterm.js) to change
  which filesystem is loaded.
